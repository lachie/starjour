h1. starjour

A wee rubycocoa gooey for monitoring scripts of the *jour fad.

You need xcode to compile it, but a pre-compiled version is here: http://rails-oceania.googlecode.com/files/starjour.zip

h2. expando ~/.jourrc

You can double click on a message to make it do something appropriate.
The builtin service spies don't really do much at the moment.

To implement your own behaviour, put something like this in @~/.jourrc@
<pre>
puts "reading .jourrc"

service('pastejour') do |service|
  (from, to) = *service.name.split('-')
  
  message = "Paste from #{from}"
  message << " to #{to}" if to
  
  ['pastejour', message, lambda {|msg| system("/opt/local/bin/pastejour '#{msg[:service].name}' | pbcopy"); 'copied to pasteboard'}]
end

# or a whole darn class, in this form:

class Paste < OSX::NSObject
  attr_reader :text

  def initWithService(service)
    if init
      @service = service

      (from, to) = *service.name.split('-')

      @text = "Paste from #{from}"
      @text << " to #{to}" if to
    end
    self
  end

  def service_name; 'paste' end

  def run
    system("/opt/local/bin/pastejour '#{@service.name}' | pbcopy")
    'copied to pasteboard'
  end
end

service('pastejour',Paste)
</pre>

h2. whence

Dr Nic was asking for help on his version (rubyjour) which we couldn't get to fly.
I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I had to get this done!
